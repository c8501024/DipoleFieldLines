# Dipole Field Animation Visualizations

This repository contains three Python scripts for simulating and visualizing the electromagnetic fields of a Hertzian or short dipole. It includes both 2D and 3D visualizations of electric and magnetic fields as well as the energy (Poynting vector) flow.

## üß† Physics Background

The scripts simulate electromagnetic fields of:
- A **Hertzian dipole**: ideal, infinitesimally short antenna.
- A **Finite-length dipole** (Stabdipol): two current sources.

Field computations are based on:
- Time-dependent dipole moment equations
- Electric field \( \vec{E} \), magnetic field \( \vec{H} \)
- Poynting vector \( \vec{S} = \vec{E} \times \vec{H} \)
- Energy density distribution

## üöÄ How to Run

### Run the 2D Animations:
```bash
python DIPOLANIMATION_E_ARROWS.py
python DIPOLANIMATION_H_ARROWS.py
